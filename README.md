### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Prior to starting week one, I had very little experience with HTML, CSS, and no experience with Javascript. Completing Lab 1 and Lab 2 was a definite struggle in the beginning mostly because of this inexperience. However, after reviewing the topics covered in the lessons and really attempting all the features presented in the Lab documentation, I felt better prepared for Lab 3 which was the assignment that prepared me the most in completing the Flixster Project. In regards to the implementing the APIs, this lab made it quicker and easier to apply the skills to work with the movie APIs. I felt unprepared to complete the CSS in terms of designing a responsive website and being able to provide more accessibility mostly becuase of my lack of experience.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have designed a better UI for the website in terms of making not only a more visually appealing design but, also, more responsive and accessible. Additionally, I would have added a feature in the top navigation bar that allows the user to search by different genres and topics (i.e. trending, current, popular). Also, my popup feature to showcase more movie information would have been completed in a format that shows the movie information rather than the placeholder it currently has and added an embedded video URL that plays the trailer automatically. In terms of adding more accessibility features, I would implemented a feature that allows the user to switch to another language and change movie display information to that language. Furthermore, I would have loved to add some form of keyboard navigation where the user can navigate through the movies or different sections of the website using just keyboard functions.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Most importantly, my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript have definitely improved more in terms of presenting both the basic functionally and being abke to manipulate different APIs to present the information necessary. In general, applying javascript elements and adding functionally to the HTML elements went better than expected as I was able to optimize different functions to perform different feature functions without writing repetitive or large amounts of code. Additionally, being able to display all the movies and movie information using the API went well. At the start of the project, I did struggle with getting the information to display because of the incorrect URL information but, through help with the TAs and different resources, I powered through and wrote better code for those functions. However, creating the popup window when a movie card is clicked was very difficult and, currently, still struggling to present the information for each movie. The formatting and design for the popup window is not how I would have liked for it to be designed and currently has placeholders rather than actual information. One thing that some of my peers did was add a section where the user can search by genre and I definitely would like to implement that feature next time.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I'd like to give a shoutout to all the TAs and peers that have helped me throughout this first week and for having the patience to deal with my many questions. Specifically, thank you to Annesa Tran, Aileen Ji, Aligary Patawaran, Kian Ranjban, and Likashmi Deosaran who helped with applying certain functions in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that were points of dfficulty for me. Thank you to Rebecca, Anitya, and Doug for making some of the most confusing console errors and function mistakes seem so simple to solve. : )
